# Numerical-discretization-using-function
In this we are going to understand the difference in the error by numerical method for different order of approximations and at the same time for different values of grid space(dx).\
The function is\

The computation of the function was done at x=pi/3 and gridspace of dx ranging from pi/4 to pi/400.\
I created fuctions of 1st, 2nd and 4th order of approximation and called them in the main code.



The Result is\
